# streamparse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Parsely/streamparse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Parsely/streamparse)

streamparse lets you run Python code against real-time streams of data. It also
integrates Python smoothly with Apache Storm.

It can be viewed as a more robust alternative to Python worker-and-queue
systems, as might be built atop frameworks like Celery and RQ. It offers a way
to do "real-time map/reduce style computation" against live streams of data. It
can also be a powerful way to scale long-running, highly parallel Python
processes in production.
